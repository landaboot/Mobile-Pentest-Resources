##### Android Tip #1 Use logcat in order to view debug information

##### Android Tip #2 To Download an APK through adb shell
- adb shell pm list packages
- adb shell pm path com.example.android
- adb pull /data/app/com.example.android/base.apk

##### Android Tip #3 Alternative ways to download an APK

##### Android Tip #4 ADB Tethering From Android to PC can be very useful when you need to bypass a proxy
 - Use Termux;
 - Make sure your Android is connected to the internet;
 - Setup a Local SSH and connect to it forwarding to a port, eg: 4455;
 - Forward that port to your PC using adb forward, eg: adb forward tcp:4455 tcp:4455;
 - Gotcha!! All connections on Pc-Local:4455 are being routed through Androids's Connection.

##### Android Tip #5 Sometimes, weaponizing can be very useful, installing tools inside Termux, whether you're root or not.

##### Android Tip #6 Sometimes in a Red/Pentest Engagement, you have nothing but a User's machine on the network and you can't install all of your tools. No problem, use adb platform tools combined with gnirehtet, previously you should pre-install all of your tools. I use Termux with a bunch of tools and scripts configured/installed, it's better having root on it.

##### Android Tip #7 You wanna have access to some internal resources through your Android ? Use Reverse Tethering, gnirehtet is a good idea.

##### Android Tip #8 Some DLP's don't look for exfiltration via adb tools, trying to exfiltrate though adb might me a good idea.

##### Android Tip #9 Iodine is a very good project to DNS Tunneling, use Andiodine, it might be useful if you want to bypass filters/captive portals.

##### Android Tip #10 Wanna bypass Captive Portals/Filters/QoS ? Some layer3 blocks are useless, tunneling SSH/VPN/DNS might help you.

 - Andiodine -> To to a DNS tunneling
 - SSH Tunneling -> Any software that connects to SSH and tunnel the whole device like HTTP Injector
 - Use a VPN on a common port, some providers have a bunch of different ports in order to do this, but you can create your own.
